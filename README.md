# (EN) Backend project

The task of the team was to write the backend part of the site in Java for the finished frontend part and implement the following functionality:

Authorization and authentication of users.
Distribution of roles between users: userDto and administrator.
CRUD for adsDto on the site: the administrator can delete or edit all adsDto, and users can only edit their own.
Under each ad, users can leave reviews.
In the site header, you can search for adsDto by name.
Show and save ad images.
The [Openapi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NInRupH5y59DMAFvUDcd2C0kIWaMk93Q/view) file was provided as a template.
